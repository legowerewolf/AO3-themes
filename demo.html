                <p>I made it as a reaction to some grievances I've had with works posted on Archive of Our Own.</p>
                <p>One problem I had was with embedded images, especially on mobile. Images would frequently overflow
                    the
                    edge of the page.</p>
                <p>Not with this formatting!</p>
                <p>Another issue I had was with the display of texting on works. I have never come across a work with
                    really well-formatted texting.</p>
                <p>One last issue I had was that you wouldn't know when to turn on work skins.</p>
                <p> Some people have it off by default, not realizing that the author has used a work skin to make the
                    work
                    look much better.</p>
